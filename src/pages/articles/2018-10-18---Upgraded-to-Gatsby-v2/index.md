## What is LSP?
LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. To understand what it is, lets take a step back and observe our programming environments. Many of us write code using an **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. These IDEs are equipped with some awesome functionalities such as tools for mass refactoring, finding unused blocks of code, code completions, detecting duplication and so much more. The rest of us use a **text editor** such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime, vim, emacs etc. Most of us use both depending on which language we are programming in.
